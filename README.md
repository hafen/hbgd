# hbgd [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HBGDki/hbgd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HBGDki/hbgd)

R package for visual and analytical methods for the analysis of longitudinal growth data.

## Installation

```r
options(repos = c(
  CRAN = "http://cran.rstudio.com/",
  tessera = "http://packages.tessera.io"))
install.packages("hbgd")
```

Note that due to a dependency on [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr), which requires the latest version of R, if you are running an older version of R you will have to manually install dplyr first.

## Use

See [here](http://hafen.github.io/docs-hbgd/).
