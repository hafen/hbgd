\title{Convert birth measurements to INTERGROWTH z-scores/centiles (generic)}
\usage{
igb_centile2value(gagebrth, p = 50, var = "lencm", sex = "Female")

}
\arguments{
\item{gagebrth}{gestational age at birth in days}

\item{p}{centile(s) to convert (must be between 0 and 100)}

\item{var}{the name of the measurement to convert ("lencm", "wtkg", "hcircm")}

\item{sex}{"Male" or "Female"}

\item{z}{z-score(s) to convert}
}

\note{
For gestational ages between 24 and 33 weeks, the INTERGROWTH very early preterm standard is used.
